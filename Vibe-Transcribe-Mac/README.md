# 🌈 Vibe Transcribe App

A vibrant local web application for audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model. Features a modern gradient UI inspired by brands like Vercel and Linear. Runs completely offline without any cloud API usage.

## Features

- **Drag-and-drop file upload** with support for multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WEBM, MP4, OPUS)
- **Real-time progress tracking** during transcription
- **Multiple Whisper models** to choose from (tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3)
- **Language selection** with auto-detection support
- **Export options** for transcriptions (TXT and PDF)
- **Automatic cleanup** of temporary files
- **File validation** with 100MB size limit
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** with Node.js (v14+) and Python 3.8+ installed
- **OpenAI Whisper** installed via pip
- **ffmpeg** (optional, for test audio generation)

## Installation

1. **Install Whisper** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip3 install openai-whisper
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify Whisper installation**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-whisper.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Upload an audio file** by:
   - Dragging and dropping onto the upload area
   - Clicking "Browse Files" to select a file

4. **Select options**:
   - Choose a Whisper model (larger models are more accurate but slower)
   - Select language or use auto-detection

5. **Wait for transcription** - progress will be shown in real-time

6. **Download results** as TXT or PDF when complete

## Model Information

| Model    | Parameters | Speed    | Accuracy | RAM Usage |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| tiny     | 39M        | Fastest  | Lowest   | ~1GB      |
| base     | 74M        | Fast     | Good     | ~1GB      |
| small    | 244M       | Moderate | Better   | ~2GB      |
| medium   | 769M       | Slow     | Great    | ~5GB      |
| large-v3 | 1550M      | Slowest  | Best     | ~10GB     |

## Troubleshooting

### Whisper not found
If you get "whisper: command not found", ensure:
1. Whisper is installed: `pip3 install openai-whisper`
2. Python's bin directory is in your PATH

### Server won't start
1. Check if port 3000 is already in use
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

### Transcription fails
1. Check available disk space
2. Ensure the audio file is valid and not corrupted
3. Try a smaller model if running out of memory

### No progress updates
Some audio formats may not show real-time progress. The transcription is still running - please wait.
